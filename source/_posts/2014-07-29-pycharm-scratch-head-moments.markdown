Well hitting Ctrl+G (eclipse profile) to "Find Usages in Project" I got "Non-code usages" - how _very_ annoying. Settings
search box > _find_ - only found the keymaps page. Finally from [Finding Usages in Project](http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/webhelp/finding-usages-in-project.html)
I got the Ctrl+Shift+Alt+F7 shortcut - untick "Search for text occurrences"
