Windows - the [Installing and starting JBoss AS on Windows][1] page says I must have both maven and java installed - I really do not get why maven so I decided to proceed at my discretion.

- Downloaded <del>jboss-eap-6.2.0.zip</del> from http://jbossas.jboss.org/downloads. A hell of a difficult site to locate. Btw the user friendliness of the JBoss site(s) is minimal - take a peek at the [Getting Started Developing Applications Guide][2] it says "This guide has move (sic) to http://www.jboss.org/jdf/quickstarts/jboss-as-quickstart/guide/Introduction/" - the latter link being broken. Plus the community servers are down.
- Realized that this download is (probably - __EDIT EDIT__: [JBoss 7.x or JBoss EAP 6.x](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17995281/jboss-7-x-or-jboss-eap-6-x)) not what I wanted. The [Installing and starting JBoss AS on Windows][3] says something about jboss-7.x.x.x - scrolling further down in http://jbossas.jboss.org/downloads I located and downloaded JBoss AS 7.1.1.Final (jboss-as-7.1.1.Final.zip).
- Unzipped jboss-as-7.1.1.Final.zip to my c:\dev
- Fired eclipse up (Luna M7 Release (4.4.0M7) - EE pack) - located the update site of Jboss tools for Luna (installing them via the servers' view failed with dependency errors) -  http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/development/luna/  - downloaded only JBossAS Tools 3.0.0.Beta1-v20140408-1231-B31, accepted, restarted, and the fun part started
- Servers > New > JBoss AS 7.1 - profile Local (...), this server requires a runtime Next
- JBoss 7.1 Runtime: download and install runtime, duh. let's see
  - one of the runtimes (3) it offers to download is the jboss-as-7.1.1.Final.zip - great - go to Browse
  - c:\dev\jboss-as-7.1.1.Final, Execution environment JavaSE-1.6 (jdk 1.6.0.45) done
- import the project, make a new branch (jbossAS7)
- run - oops:
  >WARN  [org.jboss.modules] (MSC service thread 1-6) Failed to define class x.y.Z in Module "deployment.DataCollectionServlet.war:main" from Service Module Loader: java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: x/y/Z : Unsupported major.minor version 51.0

 yep the project was 1.7 after all

- deleted the server, created it anew, pointed the runtime of Jboss server to jdk 7 and **it run** - logging needs to be info though to print anything in eclipse's console.
- yes but I couldn't hit the servlet - found the solution here: [Binding JBoss AS 7 to all interfaces][4]. In a nutshell I had to edit the server config at `C:\dev\jboss-as-7.1.1.Final\standalone\configuration\standalone.xml` - in there is the logging config too...

That was it - so basically zero modifications. Now to open shift...

<!-- more -->

###OpenShift

- Download the open shift JBoss tools from the same update site (http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/development/luna/) - JBoss OpenShift Tools (2.6.0.Beta1-v20140401-0009-B15)
- Hard part. New > Openshift application (use search), sign in to open shift (TODO: where does Eclipse store the passwords (bugzilla, openshift etc ?) - hope not in eclipse.core.runtime) > existing application (had created a jboss one) > Use existing project + create server for publishing + disable maven build > Use default remote name (untick, tick > openshift (?)) > Finish
- Scary warning about converting my project - back up original and have Beyond Compare handy
- Accept - cross fingers
- Starts downloading the repo from openshift - wish it just used github somehow... (edit: see [this blog post][7])
- OpenShift asks to publish - answer no and fire BC. .git/config only added a remote:

		[remote "openshift"]
			url = ssh://SHA@APP-DOMAIN.rhcloud.com/~/git/jbossas.git/

  good (`SHA` above stands for an hexadecimal number, the app's UUID apparently)
- .gitignore added

		target
		.settings/*
		!.settings/.jsdtscope
		.project
		.classpath
  still wander what will it do with build - notice .project .classpath removed - target added
- Added an `\.openshift\markers\` path containing only `skip_maven_build`, a `\.settings\org.jboss.tools.openshift.express.ui.prefs` file with deployment info and
- In .git it added a remote entry but also messed with HEAD and master's head - gitk: wow - a `Commit from JBoss Tools` - the changes detailed below + line endings diffs - noticed it reverts one previous line endings commit of mine - amending! _Why noone gets line endings right ever ?_
- Allright - backing the commit up (tag the original Commit from JBoss Tools)  amend, take in some unstaged line endings diffs (!) which effectively undo the reverting of my commit - finally:

        diff --git a/.gitignore b/.gitignore
        index 7f55666..3170c67 100644
        --- a/.gitignore
        +++ b/.gitignore
        // blah blah
        +target
        +.settings/*
        +!.settings/.jsdtscope
        +.project
        +.classpath
        diff --git a/.openshift/markers/skip_maven_build b/.openshift/markers/skip_maven
        new file mode 100644
        index 0000000..e69de29
  commit additional line endings diffs in a new branch to examine never
- more rebases etc and push (from git gui - allows forced updates) - <del>done</del> ! Well, not done - git reported success but the remote refs seen in gitk stayed put. I had to push from eclipse: Servers > APP at Openshift > Publish - "no local changes - publish by pushing ?" -> this now asks you if you want a forced update - yes:

		Stopping jbossas cartridge

  Wow - but where is my app ? Hmmm: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23873296/openshift-root-war-deployed-but-no-app

Producing manually the war (right click on the project then export as war) and then scp'ing straight from git Bash (msysgit, mingwin):

	$ scp "~/ROOT.war" SHA@APP-DOMAIN.rhcloud.com:/var/lib/\
	openshift/SHA/app-root/dependencies/jbossas/deployments

as detailed [here](https://www.openshift.com/kb/kb-e1088-how-to-deploy-pre-compiled-java-applications-war-and-ear-files-onto-your-openshift-gear) (detailed is an euphemism) solved it.

But now I am getting a class not found at my app's url (better than the default OpenShift page but still...):

Let's see the logs

oh well I have to enable java7 for the project - unfortunately this is done via a "marker" and trying to do it via rhc did not really help:

	$ rhc ssh jbossas
	[APP-DOMAIN.rhcloud.com SHA]\> export
	# ...
	declare -x JAVA_HOME="/etc/alternatives/java_sdk_1.6.0"
	# ...
	[APP-DOMAIN.rhcloud.com SHA]\> export JAVA_HOME=/etc/al
	ternatives/java_sdk_1.7.0
	[APP-DOMAIN.rhcloud.com SHA]\> ctl_app restart
	Cart to restart?
	1. jbossas-7
	?  1

Did not have an effect (found [this blog post][6] which explains some). I managed though - via the eclipse tools - OpenSHift Explorer > Right click on your app > Edit environmental variables:

{% img center /images/OpenShift/setting_up_java7.jpg 'image' 'images' %}

And that was it !
