[A brief on ignoring files][1]. I wish it was as simple as that.

The biggest problem for me is when I want to ignore a file that was previously tracked - ignore it forever but have it _not_ deleted when someone pulls from the remote. This is not possible unfortunately - see the comments by torek starting here

And a [git assume-unchanged vs skip-worktree][2] post that details what happens to an `--assume-unchanged` file on pull etc. Also SO questions:

- [git assume unchanged vs skip worktree - ignoring a symbolic link][3] - see this answer for `core.sparseCheckout`
- [Git - Difference Between 'assume-unchanged' and 'skip-worktree'][4]
- [Who touched my git assume-unchanged bit?][5]
- [Preserve git --assume-unchanged files between branch checkouts][6]
- [git stash and --skip-worktree files][7]
- [git-update-index(1) Manual Page][8]
- and a discussion on the mailing list with Hamano: http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/146082
- a very interesting answer explaining differences between how git expands patterns passed to it - referred to as "pathspecs" - as opposed to how shell would resolve them (globs): stackoverflow.com/questions/2899875/git-add-not-working-with-png-files/2902126#2902126
- Finally, [how to have local versions of tracked config files in git][9]

If you want to `--skip-worktree` a directory cd to the directory and issue [`git ls-files -z | xargs -0 git update-index --assume-unchanged`][10] - see there for a `find` alternative.

Glob patterns to regexes:

- Java: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1247772/is-there-an-equivalent-of-java-util-regex-for-glob-type-patterns
- Python: http://stackoverflow.com/a/1555769/281545

And btw [adding ."gitignore" to .gitignore works perfectly][11].

And git filter branch a file out: [`git filter-branch --index-filter 'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch filename' HEAD`][12]


Bonus:
- squash last 3 commits: git reset --soft head~3 && git add -A && git commit -m "Squashed 3 last commits"
- [git rebase --onto][13] - should be using it more
- [.gitignore Syntax: bin vs. bin/* vs. bin/** vs bin/][14]
