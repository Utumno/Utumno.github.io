[Repeat after me][1]:  Each unicode encoding (UTF-8, UTF-7, UTF-16, UTF-32, etc) maps different sequences of bytes to the unicode code points (therefore might as well map same sequences of bytes to different unicode code points)

Types:

- The `unicode` type stores an abstract sequence of code points. Each code point represents a grapheme.
- `str` is for strings of bytes. These are very similar in nature to how strings are handled in C.

[```uni.encode(encoding): Unicode string to a Python byte string
s.decode(encoding): convert a byte string to a Unicode string
unicode(s, encoding): convert a byte string to a Unicode string
```][2]

Important - [Python 3][3]. Important not only for guidelines but also for [clarity][4]. Moreover many "solutions" floating on the web are Python 3 (`open()` has both an encoding _and_ newlines param in P3. Both. [`open()`][3a]. ). Speaking of 2:

    with open("file.txt", 'wb')as out:
        out.write('\n')
    with open("file2.txt", 'w')as out:
        out.write('\n')
    print(os.stat('file.txt').st_size)  # 1
    print(os.stat('file2.txt').st_size)  # 2
